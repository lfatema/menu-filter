# React Menu-Filter 

A simple react based restaurant menu filter project that displays the menu. We can sort the menu based on Lunch, Breakfast and Dinner. We can also view the menu altogether by applying the 'all' filter. 

The project was developed by following the Thapa Technical tutorial on youtube channel.
